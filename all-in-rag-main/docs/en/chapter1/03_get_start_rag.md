# Chapter 3: Four Steps to Build RAG

Through the learning in Chapter 1, we have gained a basic understanding of RAG and have prepared the virtual environment and API key. Next, we will try to use the [**LangChain**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) and [**LlamaIndex**](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/) frameworks to implement and run our first RAG application. Through an example, we will demonstrate how to load local Markdown documents, process text using embedding models, and combine with large language models (LLM) to answer questions related to document content.

## 1. Start Virtual Environment

### 1.1 Activate Virtual Environment

Assuming you have created a Conda virtual environment named `all-in-rag` following the guidance in the previous chapter. Before running the script, first activate the virtual environment:

> If using Cloud Studio, you need to confirm whether you are currently in the user environment. If not, please run `su ubuntu` to switch to the user environment.

```bash
conda activate all-in-rag
```

### 1.2 Switch to Project Directory

```bash
# Assuming currently in the root directory of the all-in-rag project
cd code/C1
```

The code files for each chapter are stored in the `code/Cx` directory, where `x` represents the chapter number.

## 2. Run RAG Example Code

After completing all the above settings, you can run the RAG example.

Open the terminal, ensure the virtual environment is activated, then execute the following command:

```bash
python 01_langchain_example.py
```

> If you encounter nltk-related errors, try running [fix_nltk.py](https://github.com/datawhalechina/all-in-rag/blob/main/code/C1/fix_nltk.py) in the code path.

After the code runs, you can see output similar to the following (formatted):

```bash

Output parameter explanation:
- **`content`**: This is the core part, which is the specific answer generated by the large language model (LLM) based on your question and the provided context.
- **`additional_kwargs`**: Contains some additional parameters. In this example, it's `{'refusal': None}`, indicating that the model did not refuse to answer.
- **`response_metadata`**: Contains metadata about the LLM response.
    - `token_usage`: Shows the number of tokens consumed in this call, including completion_tokens, prompt_tokens, and total_tokens.
    - `model_name`: The name of the LLM model used, currently `deepseek-chat`.
    - `system_fingerprint`, `id`, `service_tier`, `finish_reason`, `logprobs`: These are more detailed API response information. For example, `finish_reason: 'stop'` indicates that the model completed generation normally.
- **`id`**: The unique identifier for this run.
- **`usage_metadata`**: Similar to `token_usage` in `response_metadata`, providing statistics on input and output tokens.

## 3. RAG Implementation Based on LangChain Framework

> In Chapter 1, we mentioned that the four steps to build a minimum viable system are data preparation, index construction, retrieval optimization, and generation integration. Next, we will implement a RAG application based on the LangChain framework around these four aspects.

### 3.1 Initial Setup

First, perform basic configuration, including importing necessary libraries, loading environment variables, and downloading embedding models.

```python
import os
# os.environ['HF_ENDPOINT'] = 'https://hf-mirror.com'
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_deepseek import ChatDeepSeek

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
```

### 3.2 Data Preparation

- **Load raw documents**: First define the path to the Markdown file, then use `TextLoader` to load the file as a knowledge source.
    ```python
    markdown_path = "../../data/C1/markdown/easy-rl-chapter1.md"
    loader = TextLoader(markdown_path)
    docs = loader.load()
    ```
- **Text Chunking**: To facilitate subsequent embedding and retrieval, long documents are split into smaller, manageable text chunks. Here we use a recursive character splitting strategy with its default parameters for chunking. When initializing `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter()` without specifying parameters, its default behavior aims to preserve the semantic structure of the text to the maximum extent:
    - **Default separators and semantic preservation**: Try to use a series of preset separators `["\n\n" (paragraphs), "\n" (lines), " " (spaces), "" (characters)]` in order to recursively split the text. The purpose of this strategy is to maintain the integrity of paragraphs, sentences, and words as much as possible, as they are usually the most semantically relevant text units, until the text chunks reach the target size.
    - **Preserve separators**: By default (`keep_separator=True`), the separators themselves are preserved in the split text chunks.
    - **Default chunk size and overlap**: Use the default parameters `chunk_size=4000` (chunk size) and `chunk_overlap=200` (chunk overlap) defined in its base class `TextSplitter`. These parameters ensure that text chunks meet predetermined size limits and reduce the loss of contextual information through overlap.
    ```python
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter()
    texts = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
    ```

### 3.3 Index Construction

After data preparation is complete, next build the vector index:

- **Initialize Chinese embedding model**: Use `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` to load the Chinese embedding model downloaded in the initial setup. Configure the model to run on CPU and enable embedding normalization (`normalize_embeddings: True`).
    ```python
    embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
        model_name="BAAI/bge-small-zh-v1.5",
        model_kwargs={'device': 'cpu'},
        encode_kwargs={'normalize_embeddings': True}
    )
    ```
- **Build vector storage**: Convert the split text chunks (`texts`) into vector representations through the initialized embedding model, then use `InMemoryVectorStore` to add these vectors and their corresponding original text content, thereby building a vector index in memory.
    ```python
    vectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore(embeddings)
    vectorstore.add_documents(texts)
    ```
    After this process is completed, a queryable knowledge index is built.

### 3.4 Query and Retrieval

After the index is built, you can query and retrieve based on user questions:

- **Define user query**: Set a specific user question string.
    ```python
    question = "What examples are mentioned in the text?"
    ```
- **Query relevant documents in vector storage**: Use the `similarity_search` method of vector storage to find the most relevant `k` (in this example `k=3`) text chunks in the index based on user questions.
    ```python
    retrieved_docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question, k=3)
    ```
- **Prepare context**: Merge the page content (`doc.page_content`) of multiple retrieved text chunks into a single string, separated by double newlines (`"\n\n"`), forming the final context information (`docs_content`) for the large language model to reference.
    ```python
    docs_content = "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)
    ```
    > Using `"\n\n"` (double newlines) instead of `"\n"` (single newlines) to connect different retrieved document chunks is mainly to more clearly distinguish these independent text fragments semantically when passing to large language models (LLM). Double newlines usually represent the end of a paragraph and the beginning of a new paragraph. This format helps LLM treat each chunk as an independent context source, thereby better understanding and utilizing this information to generate answers.

### 3.5 Generation Integration

The final step is to combine the retrieved context with user questions and use large language models (LLM) to generate answers:

- **Build prompt template**: Use `ChatPromptTemplate.from_template` to create a structured prompt template. This template guides the LLM to answer user questions based on the provided context (`context`) and clearly indicates how to respond when information is insufficient.
    ```python
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""Please answer the question based on the context information provided below.
    Please ensure your answer is completely based on this context.
    If there is not enough information in the context to answer the question, please directly inform: "Sorry, I cannot find relevant information in the provided context to answer this question."

    Context:
    {context}

    Question: {question}

    Answer:"""
                                              )
    ```
- **Configure large language model**: Initialize the `ChatDeepSeek` client, configure the model used (`deepseek-chat`), temperature parameter for generating answers (`temperature=0.7`), maximum number of tokens (`max_tokens=2048`), and API key (loaded from environment variables).
    ```python
    llm = ChatDeepSeek(
        model="deepseek-chat",
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=2048,
        api_key=os.getenv("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY")
    )
    ```
- **Call LLM to generate answer and output**: Format the user question (`question`) and previously prepared context (`docs_content`) into the prompt template, then call ChatDeepSeek's `invoke` method to get the generated answer.
    ```python
    answer = llm.invoke(prompt.format(question=question, context=docs_content))
    print(answer)
    ```

> Teacher, teacher, LangChain is powerful but still requires too much operation. Do you have any simpler and more user-friendly framework recommendations?

> Yes, brother, yes! There are other user-friendly frameworks like LlamaIndex😉

## 4. Low-Code (Based on LlamaIndex)

In terms of RAG, LlamaIndex provides more encapsulated API interfaces, which undoubtedly lowers the barrier to entry. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
import os
# os.environ['HF_ENDPOINT']='https://hf-mirror.com'
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, Settings
from llama_index.llms.deepseek import DeepSeek
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding

load_dotenv()

Settings.llm = DeepSeek(model="deepseek-chat", api_key=os.getenv("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"))
Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding("BAAI/bge-small-zh-v1.5")

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_files=["../../data/C1/markdown/easy-rl-chapter1.md"]).load_data()

index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

print(query_engine.get_prompts())

print(query_engine.query("What examples are mentioned in the text?"))
```

## Exercises (You can use large models to assist completion)

- Modify the parameters `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` of `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter()` in the LangChain code and observe what changes occur in the output results.
- The final output obtained from LangChain code carries various parameters. Look up relevant materials and try to filter out these parameters to get the specific answer in `content`.
- Add code comments to the LlamaIndex code.
